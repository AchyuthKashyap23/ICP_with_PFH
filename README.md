# Point Set Registration Task implemented using the Iterative Closest Point algorithm (ICP) with Point Feature Histograms (PFH) 

Final project done by Achyuth Kashyap and Madhavan Iyengar.

See Final Report for more details.

icp.py contains the algorithm implementation.
demo.py is a fully-contained script that you can run to duplicate our results on a sample point cloud.
